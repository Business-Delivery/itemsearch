# Go To Item
## Purpose
'Go To Item' was created to allow web content team members pull up items directly via URL and bypassing the search on the website. This is useful for when the search has yet to index new items and web content needs to audit the item right away.
The newest feature allows web content team members to search product images that have been previously uploaded, even if the product isn't live.
